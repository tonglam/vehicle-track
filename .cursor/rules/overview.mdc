Build a simple, secure, and easy-to-maintain admin management system with:

- Login and role-based access
- Dashboard
- Data management (CRUD)
- Clean UI for internal use

## Hosting & Infrastructure

- Hosted on Vercel (free tier initially)
- Cloudflare manages DNS, performance, security
- Domain: .com.au (~AU$20/year)

## Data & Storage

- All data stored in a managed cloud database (Supabase)
- Free tier supports thousands of records, enough for early-stage use

- Scaling later: ~USD $45/month (Vercel Pro + Supabase Pro)

## Deliverables

- Admin dashboard
- Secure login + roles

- Domain + hosting setup
- Easy future expansion

## Summary

A low-cost, secure, and scalable admin system that fits internal management needs and grows smoothly with the business.
